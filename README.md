## **1.0 Project Overview**

### **1.1 Project Title**

Digital Campus Transformation: ServiceNow Implementation for Integrated Service Management

### **1.2 Executive Summary**

This document outlines the project plan for the implementation of the ServiceNow platform within our educational organization. The primary goal is to centralize and modernize service delivery for students, faculty, and staff by replacing fragmented, manual processes with an integrated, digital-first platform. This initiative will focus on key modules including IT Service Management (ITSM), Student Service Management (SSM), and Facilities Service Management (FSM) to enhance efficiency, improve user experience, and provide a unified service portal.

## **2.0 Project Goals & Objectives**

### **2.1 Strategic Goals**

* **Enhance the Student Experience:** Provide a seamless, self-service-driven experience for all student-related inquiries, from IT support to academic advising.  
* **Improve Operational Efficiency:** Automate manual workflows, streamline processes, and reduce administrative overhead across various departments.  
* **Centralize Service Delivery:** Consolidate disparate systems and communication channels (e.g., email, phone calls, paper forms) into a single, cohesive platform.  
* **Empower Data-Driven Decisions:** Leverage ServiceNow's reporting and analytics capabilities to gain insights into service demand, performance, and resource allocation.

### **2.2 Key Objectives**

* Launch a fully functional IT Service Management (ITSM) module to manage and resolve IT incidents and service requests within 6 months.  
* Deploy a dedicated Student Service Management (SSM) portal for key administrative tasks (e.g., financial aid inquiries, enrollment issues) by the end of Year 1\.  
* Integrate the new platform with at least three existing campus systems (e.g., student information system, HR portal) within the first 12 months.  
* Achieve an initial user adoption rate of 75% for the self-service portal within the first three months of launch.  
* Reduce average ticket resolution time by 20% in the IT department within one year of go-live.

## **3.0 Project Scope**

### **3.1 In-Scope Modules**

* **IT Service Management (ITSM):** Incident Management, Problem Management, Change Management, Service Catalog, and Knowledge Management.  
* **Student Service Management (SSM):** Case Management, Student Self-Service Portal, and Knowledge Base for student FAQs.  
* **Facilities Service Management (FSM):** Request Management for maintenance, room bookings, and campus services.  
* **Service Portal:** A single, unified front-end for students, faculty, and staff to access all services.

### **3.2 Out-of-Scope**

* Human Resources (HR) Service Delivery.  
* Integration with campus security systems or physical access controls.  
* Custom application development outside of the defined project scope.  
* Full data migration of historical records from all legacy systems. Only essential data will be migrated.
